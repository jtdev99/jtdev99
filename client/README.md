# What goes into a portfolio website?

While there are no set rules, generally speaking, a portfolio website is made up of the following:

-   A homepage

    -   This is the first thing visitors sees when they come to your website.

-   A about page

    -   This is where you include personal information, for example
        -   Fullname, date of birth, telephone number, email address, home address, hometown, etc...
        -   A short statement about yourshelf and your skills.

-   A project page

    -   Visitors can see an overview of the projects you've been working on. Each project's information will usually include a picture, gif, or video, as well as a brief description detailing what was done on that project and who contributed to it.

-   A blog page

    -   This is a wonderful place to share your thoughts, experiences, and ideas regarding your career and everything else in your life. You can use your blog to discuss your most recent projects, share skills you've learned, or simply interact with people.

-   A contact page
    -   This page should include your contact information, such as your email address, phone number, and social media profiles. It is important to make it easy for potential clients to get in touch with you.
